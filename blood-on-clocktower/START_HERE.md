# 🎯 START HERE - Deployment Ready!

Your Blood on the Clocktower application is **ready for deployment**! 🎉

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### Step 1: Setup Environment
```bash
./setup_env.sh
```
This creates your `.env` file with a secure SECRET_KEY.

### Step 2: Check Readiness
```bash
./check_deployment.sh
```
This verifies everything is configured correctly.

### Step 3: Deploy!
```bash
./deploy.sh
```
This starts your application in production mode.

**That's it!** Your app will be running at `http://localhost:5002` 🎭

## 🎛️ Deployment Options

### 1️⃣ Local Production (Recommended for Testing)
```bash
./setup_env.sh    # Setup
./deploy.sh       # Deploy
```
**Access**: http://localhost:5002

### 2️⃣ Docker (Recommended for Servers)
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec web flask db upgrade
docker-compose exec web python seed_all_editions.py
```
**Access**: http://localhost:5002

### 3️⃣ Heroku (Easy Cloud Deployment)
```bash
heroku create your-app-name
heroku config:set FLASK_ENV=production SECRET_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
git push heroku main
heroku run flask db upgrade
heroku run python seed_all_editions.py
```
**Access**: Your Heroku app URL

### 4️⃣ Railway/Render (Alternative Cloud)
- Connect GitHub repo to platform
- Set environment variables in dashboard
- Platform auto-deploys
- Initialize database via platform shell

---

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Run `./check_deployment.sh` to verify:

- [x] Python 3.10+ installed
- [x] Requirements file with Gunicorn
- [x] All deployment files present
- [x] App structure correct
- [x] Database initialized
- [ ] `.env` file configured (run `./setup_env.sh`)

---

## 🔑 Important Notes

### Security
- Never commit `.env` to git (already in `.gitignore`)
- Keep your `SECRET_KEY` secret
- Use HTTPS in production

### Database
- SQLite works for small deployments
- Use PostgreSQL for production/high traffic
- Always backup your database

### First Time Setup
After deployment, you need to:
1. Run migrations: `flask db upgrade`
2. Seed data: `python seed_all_editions.py`

---

## 🆘 Need Help?

### Quick Issues

**"SECRET_KEY must be set"**
→ Run `./setup_env.sh`

**"Database not found"**
→ Run `flask db upgrade`

**"No characters in game"**
→ Run `python seed_all_editions.py`

**"Port already in use"**
→ Kill existing process or change port

Check the comprehensive guides:
- `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Full deployment instructions
- `README.md` - Application documentation

---

## 🎯 Recommended Path

**First Time?** → Use **Local Production** (Option 1)
1. Run `./setup_env.sh`
2. Run `./check_deployment.sh`
3. Run `./deploy.sh`

**For Sharing?** → Use **Heroku** (Option 3) or **Railway** (Option 4)

**Self-Hosted Server?** → Use **Docker** (Option 2)

---

## 📊 Current Status

Your application:
- ✅ Has all deployment files
- ✅ Database is initialized
- ✅ Game data is seeded
- ⚠️ Needs `.env` configuration → Run `./setup_env.sh`
